# Relationship sources — audit (MemPalace viz phase)

This is a concise map of **where graph-related relationship data comes from** in the MemPalace stack, as of this enrichment phase.

## Chroma palace (`palace_graph.py` + MCP)

| Source | Explicit / inferred | Caps / gaps | Cost |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`build_graph` → tunnel rooms** | Explicit: same `room` name appears in **≥2 wings** (Chroma metadata) | Upstream **`find_tunnels` returns at most 50 rows** (`palace_graph.py`). The viz HTTP API **does not** patch MemPalace; it **heuristically** flags possible truncation when the MCP JSON array has length 50. | One full collection scan in batches (1000 rows); linear in drawer count. |
| **`mempalace_graph_stats`** | Summary over the same graph (room counts, tunnel room count, `total_edges`, …) | `total_edges` counts **hall-labeled** edge rows in `build_graph` and can be **0** when metadata has no `hall`, even if tunnel rooms exist — do not use it as the viz edge count. Use `find_tunnels` for tunnel rows. | Same scan as `build_graph`. |
| **`mempalace_get_taxonomy`** | Explicit hierarchy: wing → room → drawer count | Taxonomy is authoritative for **which** `(wing, room)` pairs exist for resolution. | MCP/Chroma read. |

## Viz HTTP API (`server.js` + `canonical.js`)

| Source | Explicit / inferred | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Tunnel edges** | Explicit (Chroma-backed) | `relationshipType: "tunnel"`, `metadata.origin: "mempalace_find_tunnels"`, plus optional `halls` / `recent` / `drawerCountInTunnelRoom` from MCP tunnel rows. |
| **Taxonomy adjacency** | *(removed from viz)* | Was a client-side heuristic; the 3D graph now uses **tunnel edges only** from MCP. |

## Not merged into palace tunnel topology

| Source | Why |
| --- | --- |
| **SQLite knowledge graph (`mempalace_kg_*`)** | Entity/triple graph — **not** the Chroma palace tunnel graph. Exposed read-only via `/api/kg-stats`, `/api/kg-query`, `/api/kg-timeline`, and the Memory panel — never as fake room–room links. |
| **Semantic search / traverse / diary** | Official MCP tools (`mempalace_search`, `mempalace_traverse`, `mempalace_diary_read`, …) — HTTP passthrough + UI panels; **do not** add edges to `edgesResolved`. |

## Discovery overlays (`data-mining.js`)

Deterministic **client-side** signals for inspector copy and optional **emissive** emphasis on room nodes — **not** new graph geometry:

| Input | Signal |
| --- | --- |
| Tunnel `edgesResolved` (degree per room) | Hub / connector emphasis |
| Tunnel row `metadata.recent` (when parseable as a date) | Relative recency emphasis |
| **Excluded** | KG triples, semantic search scores, duplicate-check results — separate UI surfaces. |

## Cheap vs expensive

- **Cheap at query time:** merging precomputed tunnel rows with taxonomy for **endpoint resolution** in Node (pure CPU). No inferred taxonomy-adjacency edges are added to the shipped graph.
- **Expensive:** full Chroma metadata sweep (`build_graph`) — unavoidable for complete tunnel discovery unless MemPalace adds an index.
